Learn how to scrape property listings from Zillow.com using LocalScraper for handling dynamic JavaScript content.

## The Goal

Extract key property information:
- Price
- Address
- Square footage
- Bedrooms/bathrooms
- Property details
- Listing photos

## Code Example

```python
from scrapegraphai import LocalScraper

scraper = LocalScraper()

# Configure the scraper
job = scraper.start(
    url="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/",
    wait_for=".list-card",
    extraction_rules={
        "listings": {
            "selector": ".list-card",
            "multiple": True,
            "data": {
                "price": ".list-card-price",
                "address": ".list-card-addr",
                "details": ".list-card-details",
                "photos": {
                    "selector": ".list-card-img img",
                    "attribute": "src"
                }
            }
        }
    }
)

# Get results
results = scraper.get_status(job.id)
for listing in results.data["listings"]:
    print(f"Property: {listing['address']} - {listing['price']}")
```

## Best Practices

- Respect Zillow's robots.txt and terms of service
- Implement delays between requests
- Handle pagination properly
- Store results in a structured format
- Monitor for layout changes that might break selectors
